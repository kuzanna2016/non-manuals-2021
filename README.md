Materials from "Functional Data Analysis of Non-manual Marking of Questions in Sign Languages"

[We used this OpenFace tutorial for face landmark extraction](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/jcheong0428/c16146b386ea60fab888b56e8e5ee747/openface_shared.ipynb)

The repository contains:
*  FDA_tutorial.ipynb - Functional Data Analysis
*  statistical_analysis.R - statistical analysis
*  /processing - a module, that contains raw files, data combination scripts, bias prediction models, cross-validation scripts, distance calculations, scripts for plotting. Check out README in the folder for more information.
